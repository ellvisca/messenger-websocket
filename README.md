# Messenger App Using Websocket in Go

This is another project in my attempt to learn Go Programming Language.
The main point I wanted to achieve through this project is to successfully create and understand about messenger app using websocket and redis.
This extends to understanding about concurrency, websocket, and Redis.

In this project, I will be implementing some key features from Go, such as:
* [Goroutines](https://tour.golang.org/concurrency/1)
* [Channels](https://tour.golang.org/concurrency/2)

## Built With

### Programming Language
* [Go](https://golang.org/)

### Gorilla

* [Gorilla Websocket](https://github.com/gorilla/websocket)

### Redis
